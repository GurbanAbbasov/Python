# Python
This is to demonstrate my understanding of basic Python and Statistics, and showcase my first project ever (again, for fun!).

# README

# Please noe that .html file is not a code/script. It is rather a file (data visualisation output via matplolib). So, please do not open it as a raw script or try to run it. Rather, download both .csv file and .html file together to have an offline view of my project.
